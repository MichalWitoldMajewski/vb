Visual Basic macros

To run the application find macro called "showMenu". Interface is in polish. In code I use english names.
The application helped me to create printouts and also saves the data on the disk. The application allowed me to reduce the time of preparing the printout.
In 15 minutes I can archive data from one month.

Details:
On worksheet "names" on cell "A15" you can write path to save data.
The data are archive in XML file.
